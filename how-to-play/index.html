        <h3>DOWNLOAD THE GAME</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The Steam version of the game is outdated and delisted, instead you can find updated versions of the game on GitHub.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">To download the latest version, click the button below and <code>click on seclient_win_<code>version</code>.zip</code> under "Assets".</p>
        <a class="button-style-base a-button" href="https://github.com/sectorsedge/sectorsedge/releases/latest" target="_blank"><img draggable=false src="../public/win11.png" style="width:11.1px;margin:0"> Latest release</a>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">Unzip the files to a folder of your choice and run <code>sectorsedge.exe</code>. Don't worry about overwriting game files you've previously downloaded - all your settings and user data is saved in <code>%appdata%\vercidium</code>.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>PLAYING ON LINUX</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin"><b>Cap the frame rate at 59 FPS to eliminate input lag.</b></p>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The game does not always work out-of-the-box with Proton. It may be playable with:
            <details><summary>Wine</summary><p>Simply run wine sectorsedge.exe. The game has been tested to work with Wine-8.21 or greater on some systems. See here for USE flags used by the community when successfully testing.</p></details>
            <details><summary>Proton 9</summary><p>with GameMode</p></details>
        <br/>
        <h3>FINDING PLAYERS</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The best way to find players is on the community Discord server. Once you join, head over to the <code>#⁠looking-for-game</code> channel and ping the <code>@Looking for Game</code> role to call others on to play! Mention the server you're on so they can quickly join.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">We usually hop on every Saturday - check the Events menu at the top of the channel list for more details. Assign yourself the <code>@Event Pings</code> role in ⁠Channels & Roles to be notified when this happens!</p>
